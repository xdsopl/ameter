Wrote ameter.py 2011 on a weekend to learn python and havent touched it since.

ameter.py's output looks like this:

But its CPU stat output doesnt scale very well on >16 core machines and because you really can't be bothered to install python on a "Many Core Platform" I started to reimplement it in c99 and with a better scaling output.

You can quit both with a simple 'ctrl-c'

And this is how the new ameter looks like on a "Many Core Platform" at the moment:
